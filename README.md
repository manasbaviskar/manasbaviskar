## 📂 Key Projects

### **Forecasting Future Liquidity Distribution using GBRT**  
- Built rolling-window models to predict liquidity using bond-level and trade-specific predictors.  
- GBRT models significantly outperformed benchmarks (Linear, Elastic Net) in terms of DM statistics, out-of-sample R², and RMSE.

### **Transaction Cost Analysis for Corporate Bond Trading**  
- Developed a framework using TRACE data to compute expected transaction costs and price impact dynamics.  
- Implemented regularized regression to identify key determinants of trading costs.  

### **Optimal Execution Time for High-Frequency Strategies**  
- Analyzed tick-level TAQ data for Tesla and Apple stocks to evaluate order flow and trade imbalances.  
- Developed a TWAP strategy to optimize execution timing and minimize slippage.  

### **Parameter-Based Algorithmic Trading Strategy**  
- Designed statistical (Bollinger Band), trend (Parabolic SAR), and momentum-based features.  
- Trained an MLP classifier that outperformed buy-and-hold returns by 9.4% on Nifty50 data.
